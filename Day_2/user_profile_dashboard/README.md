**This React project builds a User Profile Dashboard made up of several smaller components. It includes a header with your name and avatar, profile stats, and skill badges that change color depending on your skill level (Beginner = Gray, Intermediate = Blue, Expert = Green). The components are all combined in App.jsx and styled to look clean and professional. Itâ€™s a great way to learn props, component reusability, and conditional styling in React.**
