This project builds a Product Card in React for a Nigerian e-commerce page. Each card shows a product’s image, name, and price, and tells whether it’s In Stock or Out of Stock. The card color changes green for available items and red for unavailable ones. If an item is out of stock, a gray overlay appears on the image. You’ll learn how to use props and conditional rendering to make components more interactive.
